	<div class="overview">OVERVIEW:</div>
		<p class="overview-copy">Halteman Village is a quiet, humble location with great repect for their heritage. The people of Halteman are currently working toward reestablishing their community connection. Studio 165+ was approached by Building Better Neighborhoods seeking an identity design for each neighborhood in Muncie to reflect their unique aspects and goals. </p>
	<div class="results">RESULTS:</div>
		<p class="results-copy">Because Halteman has a rich history, we chose to emphasize the shapes of the communityâ€™s long-standing architecture. This identity reflects the sharp angles and lines of the mid-century architecture found in Halteman Village. It specifcally imitates the structure of the former school house, which is the most prominent building in the community. It symbolizes the strength of the community and its enduring history. The color blue references the cool color palettes used in mid-century design.</p>
