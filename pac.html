	<div class="overview">OVERVIEW:</div>
		<p class="overview-copy">The ‘PAC’ is essentially a backpack carrying essential needs based on locations in Australia and around the world. Anyone with the desire to explore Australia or another country will enjoy the convenience and quality of this travel pack. For the Australia PAC, the product will include items exclusively for Australia. The same goes for Countries in Europe and Asia. Each backpack of the PAC product is built specifically for a certain location.</p>
	<div class="results">RESULTS:</div>
		<p class="results-copy">When making the decision to go with the PAC you are immediately saving time and energy. If you are set on having a non-traditional, off-the-grid experience you are going to need several items along the way. The purpose is to be a one stop shop with that in mind. The stress of wondering what to take along the way will be decreased greatly. The items in the PAC are chosen based on personal experience and multiple points of view. The PAC can reduce your to-do list in half by making one stop.</p>
