		<p class="overview-copy">Whitely Community Council is focused on serving and being a voice for the community. Through their goal-committees, they have built up and strengthened their community. Studio 165+ was approached by Building Better Neighborhoods seeking an identity design for each neighborhood in Muncie to reflect their unique aspects and goals.</p>
	<div class="results">RESULTS:</div>
		<p class="results-copy">Since the Whitely community takes pride in being a goal-oriented community, we decided to use a simple triangle shape to highlight it’s three most important goals: Beautification and Infrastructure, Safety and Security, and Education and Health. The triangle shape can further be used as building blocks to create the monogram “W”, and icons for various community programs initiated by the Whitely community. </p>
